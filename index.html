                Tim Berners-Lee is a software engineer who invented
                 the Internet (or the World Wide Web) in 1989 while
                  at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory.
                   He is director of the World Wide Web Consortium
                    that he founded and a Professor in the Computer
                     Science Department at the University of Oxford.
                      In 2001 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society
                       and in 2004 he was knighted.<br /><br />In 1994
                        Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium
                         (W3C) at the Laboratory of Computer Science
                          (LCS) at the Massachusetts Institute of 
                          Technology in Boston. It was made up of 
                          companies that wanted to work together to 
                          create Web standards and also improve the Web. 
                          It was quickly agreed that the technology should
                           be free of royalties and patents. Berners-Lee 
                           has served as director of this W3C since it was
                            founded. In 1995 Microsoft produced the first
                             version of Internet Explorer and this 
                             commercial browser created enormous growth in
                              websites and web users. The Web was first
                               used for e-comm.
